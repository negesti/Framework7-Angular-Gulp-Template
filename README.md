Framekwork7 with AngularJS and gulp. Dependencies are managed by npm/bower.

Forked from valnub after wathing his [Screencast](http://www.timo-ernst.net/blog/2015/11/05/video-screencast-how-to-use-framework7-with-angularjs/) **check it out!**
Valnub also created a sample app for Typescript + grunt
 * https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Typescript-Template
 
And a simple app which only uses html, css and javascript
 * https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Typescript-Template

## How to use

Install grunt and some stuff for livereload

```
npm install
```

Get AngularJS and Framework7
```
bower install
```

Enough, now it's time to let gulp make the real work :)
```
gulp
```

The "app" now runs on http://localhost:8000
